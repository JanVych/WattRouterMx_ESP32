# WattRouterMx_ESP32

WattRouterMx_ESP32 is a C project built with the [ESP-IDF](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/) framework for the ESP32 microcontroller.  
It is designed to interface with the **[WATTROUTER® Mx](https://solarcontrols.cz/cz/wattrouter_mx.html)** device, a sophisticated programmable controller for optimizing self-consumption in buildings equipped with photovoltaic or wind power systems.  

Communication with the WATTROUTER® Mx is established via **UART** and **RS-485** using the **Modbus RTU** protocol.
